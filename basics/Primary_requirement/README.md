# Primitive Datatype

Fix size and type

As the name suggest that declaring an type to a variable is Datatype.

Python does not have primitive datatype but java does as java is  statically-typed language which means you have to declare which type of variable you are going to use.
There are 8 primitive datatypes in java.
```
1. boolean type
2. byte type
3. short type
4. int type
5. long type
6. double type
7. float type
8. char type
```

# Non-Primitive datatype

Unlike primitive data types, these are not predefined. These are user-defined data types created by programmers. These data types are used to store multiple values.

Whenever we are passing a non-primitive data type to a method, we are passing the address of that object where the data is stored.

There are five types of non-primitive data types in Java. They are as follows:
```
1. Class
2. Object 
3. String 
4. list 
5. Tuple 
6. set
7. dictonary
```

# ASCII values:(0-255)

'A' --> 65

'Z' --> 90

'a' --> 97

'z' --> 122

'0' --> 48

'9' --> 57

' ' --> 32

# Operators 
```
(),[],{}> Unary Operators > Binary Operators > Ternary operators > , > =
```
## 1. Arithmetic operator

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data.
```
// , - , * , / , % , ** , +
```
## 2. Logical operator

Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. They are used in decision making.
```
uni --> not
bin --> and , or
```
## 3. Relational operator

Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.
```
bin =<, => , > , < , == , !=
```

## 4. Bitwise operator

Bitwise operators in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits. 
```
uni--> ~(bitwise negation)
bin--> & , | , ^ , << , >>
```

## 5 Shortend operator

Shortend operatorare use to make instruction statements small.
```
+= , -= , /= , *= , **= , //= , &= , |= , ^= , <<= , >>=
```
## 6 Membership operator

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

```
in, not in
```

## 7 Identity operator

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location
```
is, not is
```

# Pointers

Essentially, they are variables that hold the memory address of another variable.

Python does not support pointers while java does.
```
& --> Address of value
* --> Value at address
```

# Type casting

Type casting is a concept in programming where you change the data type of a variable from one type to another. Itâ€™s like changing a piece of clay from one shape to another.

There are two types of type casting: implicit and explicit.

1. Implicit type casting
- The programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed.
- Convenience and Automatic are advantages of implicit type casting.

2. Explicit type casting

- The programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another.
- Control, clarity and avoidance of loss of precision are major advantages of Explicit type casting.
