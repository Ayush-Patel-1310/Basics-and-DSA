# Arrays

It is one the linear data structure and which is with fix sized not that flexible and continuous. 


| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | 104 | 108 |

100,104,108 are the address of the array element and 1,2,3 are the values of the fixed array.

Arrays can't be extented while runtime and it will occupy the declared size of an array in memory.

Arrays are fast to traverse as compared to list as arrays are static data structure.
| 1 | 2 | "ayush" |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | 104 | 108 |

You can't store "ayush" in this array. 
Same datatype are to be stored in array unlike list different datatype elements can't be stored.

# List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

| 1 | 2 | "ayush" |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | 104 | 108 |

You can store "ayush" in an list no matter what kind of datatype it consist of.

List's element can be accessed by index. It supports indexing as array.

## Difference between Array and list.

| Array | List |
| :---- | :--- |
| Not flexible | flexible |
| static | Non static |
| Fixed size | Not fix size |
| Same datatype of every element | Different datatypes are allowed |
